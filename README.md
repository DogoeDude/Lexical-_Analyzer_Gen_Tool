# Lexical-_Analyzer_Gen_Tool

Context(Goal): Develop a tool that generates lexical analyzers (scanners) based on regular expressions. This project can involve translating regular expressions into finite automata and then generating code for a scanner based on the resulting automaton.
  -Create an app that has the ability to convert regular expressions down to minimized DFA
  -The minimized DFA can be considered as the scanner
  -Generate random codes that are acceptable for the scanner
  -Enumerate the codes acceptable for the scanner

I have Utilized the FAdo library that was built for Regular Expressions: https://pypi.org/project/FAdo/ or https://fado.dcc.fc.up.pt/
For graphing, I have used the GraphViz library that is directly built in VScode and has its very own software: https://graphviz.org/
For the GUI, I have utilized the Tkinter library for simplicity and efficiency.
